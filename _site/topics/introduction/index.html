<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>The People’s Guide gives practical information about how to get food, money, housing, health care and other help from government programs and community services if you live in Los Angeles County and need help in hard times. You do not have to read the entire book, just  nd the topic you need in the table of contents. However, people who are eligible for one kind of help often qualify for other programs as well, so read the entire booklet.</p>

<p>The People’s Guide also gives advice on what to do if you are treated unfairly or do not receive what you are entitled to by law.</p>

<p>Lately, massive government budget cuts have meant less help for low income families, seniors, and homeless people: fewer workers at agencies, clinics and hospitals closing, tighter rules for getting help, reduced bene ts, as well as waiting lists for many programs.</p>

<p>There are other problems with obtaining assistance: rumors and false information that discourage eligible people from even trying to get help their family desperately needs, people not knowing what the application steps are, language barriers, people being made to feel embarrassed for asking for needed help.</p>

<p>The People’s Guide is dedicated to helping all people overcome barriers when they try to get help. Every person has the right to enough food, housing, and health care. You help when you share this information with other people who need help.</p>

<p>There is another important way to help. In Sacramento, Washington DC and in County and local governments, the programs and services described in the People’s Guide are always being debated. There is a huge con ict about the money for these services.</p>

<p>Your voices are needed in those debates. Tell politicians how the programs help or don’t help and what your problems are. Government of cials need to be reminded of the tragic crises and pain that happen in people’s lives when they can’t get food, housing, or health care.</p>

<p>To get names and addresses of your local, state and federal lawmakers:
call (800) 481-8683County Registrar. or visit: www.lavote.net</p>

<p>Politicians often want to use money for other things than health, welfare and social services. But when the rich get too much richer and the poor get too much poorer, the gap has very bad effects on the whole society.</p>

<p>You can help close that gap. You don’t have to be an expert. Simply let those in authority know how a budget cut affects you or your neighbors.</p>
