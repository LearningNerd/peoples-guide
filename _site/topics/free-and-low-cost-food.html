<p>Food pantries are places that give food to people in need. Most food pantries are volunteer private organizations that can make their own rules about who can be served. Most of them are limited to serving people in certain areas and for one to four times a month. They may require some kind of identi cation and proof that you are low income. Generally, food pantries never have as much as is needed. Foods distributed most often include canned foods, rice, beans, bread, cereal, and oc- casionally produce items.</p>

<p>Free hot meals are offered at many private volunteer agencies and churches. The frequency of the meals varies from daily in some places to once a month.</p>

<p>There are over 500 places in LA County that distribute food bags or hot meals for free so we cannot list them all. Here are some food or referral agencies. Bring someone with you that can help you carry boxes or bags of food and produce since sometimes they are very heavy.</p>
