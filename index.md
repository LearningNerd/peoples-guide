# Welcome to the People's Guide. We are here for you!

The Peopleâ€™s Guide gives practical information about how to get food, money, housing, health care and other help from government programs and community services if you live in Los Angeles County and need help in hard times.

However, people who are eligible for one kind of help often qualify for other programs as well, so read the entire booklet. *[Read more...](topics/introduction.html)*
